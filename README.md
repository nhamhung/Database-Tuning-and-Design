# A database tuning and design repository

## Tuning

- Exploration of performance of different but equivalent SQL queries on Postgres and PgAdmin4 to understand the query planning and execution. 

## Design

- Implementation of functional dependencies and related algorithms to compute: 

1. Attribute closure
2. Minimum cover
3. Testing for normal forms
4. Decomposition algorithm (Not dependency preserving, maybe BCNF)
5. Systhesis algorithm (guaranteed 3NF)
